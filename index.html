        <h2>I would like to visit Paris</h2>
        <p>Paris is a diverse and sophisticated city that appeals to the wealthy but can also be enjoyed on a budget. In addition to the Eiffel Tower, Paris has countless other gorgeous landmarks and monuments that add to the beauty of the spacious boulevards and their charming cafés.
            French cuisine is also world-famous, and you can find some of the best of it in Paris. There is world-class shopping and a dynamic fashion scene, and plenty of interesting museums and art galleries.
            Just outside Paris, there are plenty of fun day trips to take for further insight into the culture and history of France.</p>

<p>Museum Africa has to be one of the most beautiful buildings in the CBD. And not only is it beautiful, it’s also home to a number of cultural, historic, artistic exhibits that have been sourced from across the country. These exhibits consist of thousands of irreplaceable items of an anthropological and archaeological nature which gives us a better understanding of Africa’s past, present and future. Best of all, entrance is FREE!</p>

            <h4>Apartheid Museum</h4>
            <p>The Apartheid Museum holds the damning evidence of the darkest era in our history. If you’re looking to understand and experience what it was really like to be a person of colour during that time, a visit to the Apartheid Museum is a must. Expect to see exhibits including photographs, film footage, text panels, artifacts and, of course, heart rendering stories that expose the atrocities committed during apartheid. Now, the museum stands as a beacon of hope for all mankind.</p>
